# AiIntrusiondetection
This project builds an AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System to improve network security. It collects network traffic data, cleans and processes it, and trains machine learning models to detect attacks. The system classifies traffic as normal or malicious and generates instant alerts to help prevent cyber threats and protect company networks.
